rust-project_euler
==================

This is my take at solving the Project Euler problems (with far-from-optimal
solutions, mind you), and learning Rust along the way.

If you want to play around, just make sure you have the latest rust nightly
installed, and run `make` on the toplevel dir. This will create a binary per
problem on the `bin` directory.
