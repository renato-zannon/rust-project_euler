rust-project_euler
==================

![Project Euler badge](http://projecteuler.net/profile/riccieri.png)

This is my take at solving the Project Euler problems (with far-from-optimal
solutions, mind you), and learning Rust along the way.

If you want to play around, just make sure you have the latest rust nightly
and cargo installed, and run `cargo build` on the toplevel dir. This will
create a binary per problem on the `target` directory.
